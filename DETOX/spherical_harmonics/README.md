# Spherical Harmonic Analysis, DETOX models

To run the notebook `DETOX_SH_analysis.ipynb`:

1. Download DETOX models from: https://zenodo.org/record/3993276#.Xz6xE5NKjlw
2. Store the models in the current directory (i.e., `SubMachine_Public/DETOX/spherical_harmonics/DETOX_MODELS`)
3. Install required packages:

```bash
- netCDF4
- pyshtools
- matplotlib
- numpy
```

4. Continue with [DETOX_SH_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/kasra-hosseini/SubMachine_Public/blob/master/DETOX/spherical_harmonics/DETOX_SH_analysis.ipynb).
